It is so funny when I look back to where I was before. Nothing specially has changed but it feels like everything changed in a very small amount of time. I am constantly trying to learn and understand technical concepts, now a days I am on a journey for learning **cloud concepts, Networking concepts, and internet** in general. Although, I know I might not be able to get a job in tech yet but noting is going to go into waste. even if it is 10 min a day everything will add up at the end of the day. The key is to not give up!!!!
